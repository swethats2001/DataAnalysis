# DataAnalysis

Here I worked on a dataset, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns.The tasks I did include preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting your findings graphically.
Here's a breakdown of the steps I followed:

Preprocessing:
Correct the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180 using np.random.randint() function. Ensure data consistency and integrity before proceeding with analysis.

Analysis Tasks:
1. Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees. (2 marks)
2. Segregate employees based on their positions within the company. (2 marks)
3. Identify the predominant age group among employees. (2 marks)
4. Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure. (2 marks)
5. Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually. (2 marks)
